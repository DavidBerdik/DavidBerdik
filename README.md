# Hi there, I'm David Berdik! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my GitHub profile! I'm a software engineer and educator with a passion for writing code to solve real-world problems and teaching others how to do the same. I've been programming since 2010, and over the years, I've had the opportunity to do so many cool things including working on large-scale projects at General Dynamics and Amazon, teaching Computer Science as a full time instructor at my alma mater alongside my own former professors, and contributing to building text analysis software that has been used for everything from revealing J.K. Rowling's pen name to solving murders.

I also enjoy working on my own projects and collaborating with friends on projects like [CaptureSposed](https://github.com/99keshav99/CaptureSposed/). Some of my projects such as MACsposed and Function Key Row are not open source, but for projects that are, feel free to take a look at them and reach out if you'd like to chat!

## By the way, I'm looking for a new job.
